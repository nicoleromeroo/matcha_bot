# Matcha Bot

A Python-based stock availability notification bot that monitors online shops and sends alerts when specific items (like matcha products) are back in stock. Designed for practical automation using web scraping, scheduled checks, and messaging integrations.

## Features

- Checks product availability from specific URLs
- Scheduled or periodic scraping logic
- Sends notifications through messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram or WhatsApp)
- Easily customizable for other products or websites

## Use Case

Originally developed to track stock for matcha powder from niche online shops. Can be repurposed to monitor sneakers, electronics, or any frequently out-of-stock item.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` ‚Äì for scraping product pages
- `schedule` or `time` ‚Äì for repeated execution
- Messaging integrations (e.g., Telegram, Twilio)
- `.env` file for environment-based configuration
